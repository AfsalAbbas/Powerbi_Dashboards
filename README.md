# PowerBI-Dashboards

## 1. Blinkit Dashboard Project

This repository contains a Power BI dashboard I created to study Power BI tools and techniques. The dashboard is based on a sample dataset similar to Blinkit's operations and provides insights into order metrics, customer behavior, and delivery performance.

> **Note**: This project was completed by following a tutorial on YouTube to strengthen my Power BI skills.

## Project Overview

The **Blinkit Dashboard** offers a comprehensive view of key business metrics, such as:
- Total Orders and Revenue
- Customer Demographics and Order Patterns
- Delivery Performance and Timeliness
- Order Categories and Product Insights

This project helped me practice various Power BI tools, including data cleaning, transformation, and visualization techniques.
